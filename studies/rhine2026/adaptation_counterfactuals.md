# Adaptation counterfactuals for the Nature Communications paper (plan, 10 Sep 2026)

Target journal decided 10 Sep: Nature Communications (event paper; the modelling contribution goes to
Methods/SI or a JEDC companion). The counterfactuals answer "what would have blunted the 2026 losses":
each lever has a real-world counterpart in the 2026 debate, one implementable switch in the model, and a
paired run against the baseline it is compared with. Levers act on the physical channel (who can sail,
with what load, what buffers exist, what the alternative modes offer); they do not touch demand.

## Levers

| # | lever | real-world counterpart | model implementation | runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | fairway deepening | Abladeoptimierung Mittelrhein (WSV): +20 cm fairway depth Budenheim–St. Goar, planned for the 2030s | evaluate the draught table and the class floors at gauge + 20 cm: new driver flag `--gauge-offset 20` (`--gauge-offset 10` as the half-built variant if wanted) | 1 (+1) |
| B | low-water fleet | purpose-built shallow-draught tankers and bulkers (Stolt Ludwigshafen ~800 t at 30 cm, 9 such ships in Aug 2026; HGK's EUR 12.5 bn fleet call) | tank-barge floor 50 → 40 cm (fleet partly renewed: the 42–49 cm tail weeks open) and a renewed bulk fleet sailing to 20 cm (`liquid_bulk=20,dry_bulk=20`, containers unchanged) with the low-water draught table `draught_table_lowwater.csv` (+0.10 load factor in the 15–55 cm band): the 22–29 cm weeks become surcharge weeks for bulk, the 11–12 cm weeks stay closed. A 30 cm floor would change nothing at 27–29 cm (dry-run check) | 2 |
| C | input stocks | one more week of raw-material stock (strategic fuel stocks for hauliers and power plants; refinery and chemical feedstock) | `--inventory-add-days 7` on every goods input (new flag; global variant) and a targeted YAML variant: buyers of barge-borne fuel, feedstock and cement (H49/H50/H52, D, C20, C23, C24A) +7 d only | 2 |
| D | rail relief | tank-car trains and extra paths on the Rhine valley lines (DB Cargo's ≈ 100-barge ceiling; the second track debate) | DECIDED 10 Sep: the cost version. `--rail-relief 0.4` = a `transport_cost_shock` × 0.4 on every rail edge for liquid and dry bulk in every shock week (tank-car rail at the bulk rate, 0.085 → 0.034 USD/tkm), containers unchanged. Code check: `send_shipment` searches the alternative route on the network with the current cost labels (`provide_shortest_route`, `start_edge_cost_shock` rewrites `cost_per_ton_<cargo>`), so a Rhine link facing a closure sees the cheaper rail and gives up less. The capacity version (`--constraint-mode gradual`, headroom 1.3 vs 1.8) is not run: a quantity cap, outside the baseline's philosophy | 1 |
| E | package | A + B (renewed fleet, 20 cm) + C (global) | all three switches | 1 |

Expected direction: A and B shorten the closure spells (the 27–42 cm weeks become surcharge weeks for the
classes concerned), C moves the fuel-driven losses of the first closure weeks later or removes them,
D lowers the give-up of bulk in closure weeks, E shows complementarity (package vs sum of parts).

## Runs and pairing

- Profile: the same as the baseline they are compared with. Now: the forecast-based 2026 profile
  (`2026_seed42_pool_fc0910`, 19 weeks); the whole set is rerun on the final observed profile when the
  event is over (November), when the paper's numbers are frozen. The September pairs serve the draft.
- Settings: the confirmed baseline (v13 rates, closure floors, voyage surcharge, input pooling, seed 42),
  light exports, 12 recovery weeks (the tail of the pooled runs ends 4–6 weeks after the last shock; the
  net/delay accounting is reported on the 20-week baseline run and on the counterfactuals at 12 weeks).
- Metrics per pair: DEU and EU value-added loss (gross, net, delay), peak week and its level, weeks with
  losses, corridor firms below 99 % of baseline at the peak, household consumption loss, Kaub tonnage
  by week (A and B also change the physical throughput — the ex post consistency check).
- Names: `2026_fc0910_<lever>` with lever ∈ {base, deep20, fleet40, fleet20, stock7, stock7t, rail04, package}
  and the grid runs (`cluster/jobs_20260910.txt`).
- Cost: 32 steps ≈ 5 h each on the laptop (one run at a time, ≈ 12.6 GB RAM) → 7–8 runs ≈ 4 nights;
  on the cluster all pairs in one batch of ≈ 6 h. The sensitivity grid for the uncertainty band (seeds
  × 3, tanker floor ± 10 cm, inventories ± 50 %, Lower Rhine factor 0 and 1, no pooling, v12 rates)
  belongs in the same batch: ≈ 8 more runs.

## Status (16 Sep, 15:00) — paper batch on the calibrated buffer read

`2026_cal_base` 0.54 % of a quarter (peak 1.42 % of a week in week 17; August wave 0.13 %, September wave 0.41 %),
ensemble 0.52 ± 0.14 % (0.31–0.76), `2018_inv200` 0.32 % (peak week 21). Levers (DEU gross avoided): fleet20 −95 %,
deep20 −41 %, fleet40 −39 %, stock7 −39 %, package −100 %; the fairway and the tanker floor at 40 cm remain one lever
in the model (they remove the same tank-barge closure weeks). Targeted stocks: the cluster run was wrong (the inventory
helper scaled the listed sectors only; fixed, KI-36); the laptop rerun gives −29 % (0.385 %), three quarters of the
all-buyer lever. Band: tanker floor 40 /
50 / 60 cm 0.33 / 0.54 / 0.75 %, stocks ×1 / 1.5 / 2 2.16 / 0.82 / 0.54 %, no pooling 0.86 %. Figures F4–F8 and
`levers_20260916.csv` come from these runs. The paper numbers are these unless the event-end profile refresh
(November) moves them; the rail lever is out, the Lower Rhine factor a price parameter, the price give-up threshold
removed from the story.

## Status (16 Sep, 10:30) — ladder read, multiplier picked

2018 at ×1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2: 0.67 / 0.51 / 0.41 / 0.32 % of a quarter, peak in week 21 (3 Dec) throughout; ×1.5 with
the tanker floor at 40 cm 0.22 %. Pick ×2 (all inventories rather than raw materials only; lower edge of the
0.3–0.4 % target, right peak week); the 2026 August wave falls to 0.13 % of a quarter (≈ EUR 1.2 bn, inside the ex
ante), the 2026 total to 0.54 % (12 recovery weeks). Stage 2 launched on `jobs_20260916_paper.txt` at
`--inventory-scale 2.0`: base with 20 recovery weeks, twins, ten seeds, five levers, tanker floor 60; the 2018
calibrated baseline is `2018_inv200`. The tanker floor stays at 50 cm with 40 / 60 as the structural band.

## Status (16 Sep) — calibration route decided (Occam pass)

User decision on the recommendation: freeze every mechanism that is structural or evidence-anchored (survey
criticality with the 2 % floor, input pooling, cargo closure floors 40/50/30, voyage surcharge with cargo rates,
the settled modal-switch rule) and calibrate ONE parameter, the input-stock buffer, on the 2018 ex post
(0.3–0.4 % of a quarter, peak late November / early December). Why stocks: the Bundesbank targets count
raw-material stocks at the buyer only; the supplier's finished goods, the buyer's work in progress and the
October 2018 fuel-reserve release are buffers the model lacks, so a multiplier of 1.5–2 is the buffer the
evidence describes, not a fit; it also reconciles the 2026 August-wave ex ante (model 0.51 % of a quarter
against IfW EUR 1–2 bn) with the same move. Dropped from the paper set: the delivered-price give-up threshold
(never binds), the Lower Rhine factor as a lever (price parameter only), rail at the bulk rate (inert by
construction), floors ±10 cm (duplicate the tanker-floor axis). Stated limitations, not targets: the DIHK
extensive margin, the missing pipeline mode, binary closures. Stage 1 `cluster/jobs_20260916_cal2018.txt`
(2018 ladder ×1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2, ×1.5 with the tanker floor at 40 cm as a cross-check, 2026 at ×2;
launched with `--independent`, no base chain), stage 2 `cluster/jobs_20260916_paper.txt` (base, twins,
ensemble, five levers, tanker floor 60; multiplier to set after the pick). Then freeze the numbers, redraw
F4–F8 with `--prefix 2026_cal_`, rewrite the ladder as evidence-anchored mechanisms + one calibrated buffer
+ structural band (tanker floor, draws).

## Status (15 Sep, 21:30) — batch on the settled rule read

All 28 runs of `cluster/jobs_20260911.txt` on 8d26c6c (`rhine_batch_20260915_1904.tgz`). Base 2.16 % of a quarter
(2.74 before the fix), ensemble 1.85 ± 0.44 %, 2018 1.34 % (1.73). Levers (DEU gross avoided): fleet20 −92 %, stock7 −65 %,
deep20 −49 %, fleet40 −48 %, stock7t −28 %, rail04 ±0 (the +13 % was the KI-35 artefact; the lever is inert now, as the
model has no delivery-time channel through which cheaper rail could help bulk that the modal-switch penalty forbids to
move), package −100 %. Grid: lr0 = lr1 = base (the Lower Rhine factor is a price parameter only), floors −10 cm = deep20
= fleet40 = 1.11 %, tanker floor 60 = floors +10 = 2.70 %, stocks ×0.5 5.96 %, ×1.5 0.82 %, no pooling 4.67 %. Figures
F4–F8 and `additional_data/levers_20260915.csv` come from these runs. Open before the paper numbers are frozen: the
calibration overshoot (three to four times the evidence; stocks ×1.5 and the tanker floor at 40 cm each halve it), the
event-end profile refresh (November), the rail lever's framing (inert by construction), and the missing pipeline mode
(crude by barge through Kaub) as a stated limitation.

## Status (15 Sep, 12:00)

Decision taken on the recommendation: the 50 km access allowance stays and road is never a line-haul mode for bulk
(`switching_costs.line_haul_modes`, disrupt-sc 8d26c6c). Verified on the ten-week laptop pair: 75 % of the week-6 Kaub
bulk gives up (kilometre rule 67 %, old code 81 %), predicted link by link by the offline classification; German loss
over ten weeks 0.40 % of a quarter (0.39 / 0.55). The 28-run cluster batch (`cluster/jobs_20260911.txt`, base with
`--cache auto`, caches valid since the fingerprints exclude the switching costs) is to be relaunched on this commit
(advised 15 Sep morning; launch is the user's step); pack with `--with-firms 2026_fc0910_base,2018_baseline,2026_fc0910_package`, then redraw F4–F8 and rewrite the
ladder. Expect the new base near or somewhat below the 13 Sep 2.74 % and `lr0` equal to the base (the Lower Rhine
factor is no longer a calibration lever); the overshoot decision rests on the stock and tanker-floor levers.

## Status (14 Sep, 23:30)

The 13 Sep batch numbers are read (base 2.74 %, ensemble 2.29 ± 0.47 %, levers, grid: README §2.2b, `calibration_log.md`)
but the batch carries the KI-35 artefact: the alternative-route search was penalty-blind, so any Lower Rhine surcharge
sent Kaub-crossing bulk to a rail path that the modal-switch penalty then rejected (factor 1/3 = factor 1 = base, factor
0 different; closure losses roughly doubled). Fixed on 14 Sep (penalty-aware search + line-haul modal-switch rule,
disrupt-sc 0d085ef) and verified on the ten-week laptop pair: German closure-week losses 28–33 % below the old base
(0.39 vs 0.55 % of a quarter over ten weeks), the run reproduced link by link by an offline classification of the
2,831 Kaub-crossing bulk OD pairs. Before the batch is relaunched the user decides the two thresholds: the 88 km road
bypass of the closed Kaub reach is a switch only because it exceeds the 50 km access allowance (at 90 km almost no
Kaub bulk gives up), and routes with 100 km or more of road already may lengthen that leg without limit (35 % of the
Kaub-crossing bulk pairs, median +206 km). Then: relaunch the 28 runs (`cluster/jobs_20260911.txt`, base with
`--cache auto`; caches valid, run-time change only), pack with `--with-firms 2026_fc0910_base,2018_baseline,2026_fc0910_package`,
redraw F4–F8 and rewrite the ladder on the new numbers. Rail relief (`rail04`) stays unexplained; the crude-by-barge
representation (no pipeline mode) is a paper limitation.

## Status (13 Sep)

The 11 Sep batch reused the cluster's pre-fix caches for every shared-cache run (base, 2018, twins, levers,
grid): those numbers equal the 10 Sep ones and are the pre-fix draw. The ten isolated seed runs are valid
fixed-code draws (German loss 1.28–2.87 % of a quarter, mean 2.25). Relaunch of the 18 shared-cache runs with
rebuilt caches: `cluster/jobs_20260913.txt`; the stage fingerprints now carry a build version. Rail relief
(`rail04`) on the pre-fix draw: more bulk reroutes to rail (liquid alternative share 1.4 → 6.7 %) but the blocked
share does not fall and the loss is 8 % higher, mostly in the post-closure tail — not understood; a laptop
diagnostic pair with full exports on the first ten weeks is the next step before the lever is used.

## Status (11 Sep, 07:00)

The 10 Sep batch ran (18 runs) but was a pre-fix draw (KI-34: the build was order-dependent, so cluster and
laptop worlds differed by 3x). Relaunched as `cluster/jobs_20260911.txt` on the deterministic build: the two
baselines (20 recovery weeks), their no-pooling twins, a 10-seed ensemble of the 2026 baseline, the seven levers
and the seven grid runs. Lever effects on the pre-fix draw, for orientation only: fleet20 −90 %, stock7 −62 %,
deep20 −32 %, fleet40 −31 %, stock7t −24 %, package −100 %, rail04 +8 % (to be understood before use).

## Status (10 Sep, 11:30)

Implemented and tested (driver commit of 10 Sep): `--gauge-offset`, `--inventory-add-days D[:SECTORS]`,
`--inventory-scale`, `--rail-relief`, `--cache-isolation`; `scenarios/draught_table_lowwater.csv`. Cluster batch:
`cluster/jobs_20260910.txt` (1 base + 7 counterfactuals + 10 grid runs), `cluster/launch_rhine_batch.sh` (Slurm,
`--wrap` jobs, base first then afterok; postprocess per run; compare job at the end), `cluster/sync_to_cluster.sh`,
`cluster/collect_from_cluster.sh`. 12 recovery weeks (user decision). The user submits on the cluster.

## Code changes (small, driver-side)

1. `run_rhine.py --gauge-offset <cm>`: added to every weekly gauge before the draught table and the
   floors (the profile file stays the observed record). Test: the 2026 schedule at +20 cm.
2. `run_rhine.py --inventory-add-days <d>` (and `--inventory-scale <f>`): applied to the goods entries of
   the loaded inventory YAML, service days untouched. Test: the loaded targets.
3. `scenarios/draught_table_lowwater.csv`: the central table with the load factor raised by 0.10 between
   15 and 55 cm (a fleet in which low-water vessels carry a tenth of the normal tonnage at those gauges),
   anchors documented in the file.
4. Rail relief: `run_rhine.py --rail-relief <multiplier>`: a `transport_cost_shock` on every rail edge for
   liquid and dry bulk in every shock week. Verified by code reading (the alternative-route search uses the
   current cost labels), not yet by a run: the `rail04` pair must show a lower blocked share and give-up in
   closure weeks than `base` (routing_summary / section 6 of the analysis); if it does not, the lever is inert
   and the reason must be found before the paper uses it.
5. Queue v17 (laptop) or a cluster job list; the watcher analyses each run; `compare_runs.py` on the pairs;
   a figure "avoided loss by lever" (`plots/scenario_figures.py`, new panel).

## Paper use

Figure: avoided German and EU value-added loss by lever (gross and net), with the package; table of the
lever definitions and their real-world anchors; one paragraph on complementarity and on what the model
cannot say (pipeline mode absent, no rationing of trucks and drivers, no demand-side throttling).
