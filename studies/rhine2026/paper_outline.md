# Paper outline — "A spatial supply-chain model of the European Union: the Rhine low-water summer of 2026"

Working title and skeleton (3 Sep 2026). Every figure/table names the model output or
data file it comes from, so the pipeline can produce it without re-deciding.

## 1. Introduction
- Inland waterways carry 5 % of EU inland tonne-km but a third of the bulk feedstock of the
  Rhine industrial belt (chemicals, steel, refining, power, agri-food); the Rhine alone ≈ 150 Mt/yr
  at the Dutch–German border.
- 2018 and 2022 showed the macro footprint of a river that cannot be sailed (Ademmer et al. 2023:
  −1 % industrial production per 30 days of Kaub < 78 cm; ≈ −0.4 % GDP in 2018). 2026 broke the
  record: Kaub 8–11 cm in mid-August, three weeks de facto closed, force majeure across the
  chemical belt (evidence dossiers, §2 and §11 of `evidence/`).
- Gap: existing evaluations are ex post econometrics (national IP) or single-firm accounts; no
  model resolves *which* firms, *through which* transport substitutions, *how far* down the
  supply chain. Contribution: first whole-EU spatial agent-based supply-chain model (28 countries,
  50 sectors, 13k firm points, TEN-T multimodal network with 10k edges), and its application to the
  2026 event with a weekly gauge-driven scenario validated against firm surveys, freight statistics
  and macro estimates.

## 2. Model (DisruptSC v2, EU scope)
- Agents and network: firms placed by plant/employment data (firm-extractor), households at NUTS2,
  external partners at sea/border nodes; OECD ICIO 2022 technical coefficients; commercial links
  with cargo types; TEN-T roads/rail/waterways/maritime + terminal connectors.
- Transport costs and mode choice: per-mode USD/tkm, per-cargo (and per-mode) value of time,
  per-cargo terminal transfer costs; winner-take-all routing per OD pair. Table: calibrated
  parameters (final config).
- Disruption mechanics used here: cost shocks (surcharge → pass-through / reroute / give-up) and
  closures; cargo-type-specific switching costs (tank barges and ore trains have no road/rail
  equivalent at volume, so bulk pays the surcharge while the river is open and gives up when it is
  closed; containers reroute); inventories (30 days for goods, import bundles included), rationing,
  price propagation; partially-binding Leontief with the IHS Markit survey criticality (baseline
  since 4 Sep). No capacity-constrained routing and no quantity cap on substitutes (state why: the
  substitution-ceiling experiment of 3–4 Sep withheld 16 bn USD directly and cascaded to 30 % of a
  quarter — a quantity constraint is not the model's philosophy).
- Figure 1: the network and the firm geography (map; Rhine chain highlighted, Kaub edge).

## 3. Calibration and validation of the baseline
- Economics: output/exports/imports vs the MRIO (Table: 93.6 % / 98 % / 89 %; 49/50 sectors).
- Flow assignment vs Eurostat 2023: inland modal split per country and per cargo class
  (Figure 2: model vs data bars, road/rail/IWW, DE NL FR BE AT PL IT + EU); port entries vs
  `mar_go_aa`; Rhine profile Basel→Rotterdam vs CCNR cross-sections (Figure 3: tonnage along
  the river, model vs data, with Kaub and Emmerich marked).
- Honest residuals: short-haul road traffic absent by construction (NUTS2/3 geometry), ore/coal
  reach Upper-Rhine electric-arc mills because national coefficients ignore the process route,
  port shares depend on the sea-leg value of time.

## 4. The 2026 scenario
- Inputs: weekly Kaub gauge (PEGELONLINE/BfG) → draught table → capacity factor → cost multiplier
  or closure (Figure 4: gauge, capacity factor and schedule, 22 Jun – 26 Oct 2026, forecast weeks flagged).
- Runs (baseline definition of 4 Sep, user decisions): survey criticality, import bundles by MRIO
  composition, firm inventories by buying industry (Bundesbank stock days), cargo-specific switching
  costs, one delivered-price give-up threshold (5), no quantity cap: `2026_seed42_base`; the 2018
  profile with the same baseline; the cost-only bound (unlimited substitution, 3 Sep) as reference;
  the substitution-ceiling experiments (0.30, 0.70, survey variant) reported as what a quantity cap
  does; sector-specific give-up thresholds evaluated from the 2018/2026 evidence and not adopted;
  no-disruption control (drift check). Closure floors by cargo class (5 Sep: container ≤ 40 cm,
  tank barges ≤ 50 cm, dry bulk ≤ 30 cm; van Dorsser 2020, Contargo): `2026_seed42_floors`,
  `2018_seed42_floors` — results 5 Sep: 2026 DEU 1.20 bn (0.125 % of a quarter, inside IfW's EUR 1–2
  bn), 2018 DEU 2.03 bn (0.21 % of a quarter, peak 0.58 % of a week in late November, about two-thirds
  of the ex-post −0.3/−0.4 % GDP) → ADOPTED as the final baseline on 6 Sep (physical-stoppage
  baseline); the earlier runs are reported as the ladder (single floor, press profile) and the
  floors-plus-thresholds variant as the upper-bound reading. Then two calibration steps (8–10 Sep): cargo-specific
  waterway rates (v13: liquids on the river at the Eurostat share → 2026 DEU 3.56 bn = 0.37 %, 2018 8.60 bn =
  0.90 % with a second-round cascade in late November/December) and input pooling of commodity-like
  products across regions (`2026_seed42_pool` 3.55 bn = 0.37 %, peak in the 11 cm week; `2018_seed42_pool`
  5.57 bn = 0.58 %, peak 1.2 % of a week in the first week of December, cascade cut by two-thirds) →
  candidate final baseline (10 Sep, confirmed); then KI-34 (11 Sep): the supply-chain build was order-dependent,
  every run before 13 Sep a single unreproducible draw. Reproducible seed-42 draw (cluster, 13 Sep):
  `2026_fc0910_base` DEU 26.2 bn = 2.74 % of a quarter (ensemble of 11 draws 2.29 ± 0.47), peak 5.3 % of a
  week in mid-October; `2018_baseline` 16.5 bn = 1.73 %, peak 3.6 % in the second week of December. The model
  overshoots the 2018 ex post (−0.3/−0.4 %) by ~4x on typical draws: the paper must report the ensemble and
  treat the propagation strength (pooling, stocks, tanker floor, Lower Rhine surcharge) as the calibration
  question, not one draw. Levers (seed-42 draw): fleet to 20 cm −91 %, stocks +7 d −62 %, fairway +20 cm −41 %,
  tank barges 40 cm −41 %, package −100 %; rail at the bulk rate +13 % (not understood, not for the paper yet). Then KI-35
  (14–15 Sep): the alternative-route search was penalty-blind, so any Lower Rhine surcharge sent Kaub-crossing bulk to a
  rail path that the modal-switch penalty then rejected (the rail lever's +13 % was this artefact) → penalty-aware search
  and the line-haul modal-switch rule (50 km access allowance, 100 km line-haul threshold, road never a line-haul mode for
  bulk), verified link by link on ten-week pairs. Batch of 15 Sep on the settled rule (the paper numbers unless the
  calibration route changes): `2026_fc0910_base` DEU 20.7 bn = 2.16 % of a quarter (ensemble of 11 draws 1.85 ± 0.44,
  range 1.04–2.49), peak 4.2 % of a week in mid-October; `2018_baseline` 12.8 bn = 1.34 %, peak 2.8 % in the second week
  of December; no pooling 4.67 / 2.12 %. Levers: fleet to 20 cm −92 %, stocks +7 d −65 %, fairway +20 cm −49 %, tank
  barges 40 cm −48 %, targeted stocks −28 %, package −100 %, rail at the bulk rate ±0 (inert by construction: no
  delivery-time channel). Grid: Lower Rhine factor 0 = factor 1 = base (a price parameter only), stocks ×1.5 0.82 %,
  tanker floor 40 cm 1.12 %. The overshoot against the 2018 ex post is three to four times on typical draws — the
  calibration question of the paper. Resolved 16 Sep (Occam pass): every evidence-anchored mechanism frozen, ONE
  calibrated parameter — the input-stock buffer, ×2 on the Bundesbank raw-material days (all inventories rather than
  raw materials only; the October 2018 fuel-reserve release is such a buffer), picked on the 2018 ladder (×1.25 / 1.5 /
  1.75 / 2 → 0.67 / 0.51 / 0.41 / 0.32 % of a quarter, peak in the first week of December throughout) against the
  ex-post 0.3–0.4 %. PAPER NUMBERS (16 Sep batch, `2026_cal_*`, `2018_inv200`): 2026 DEU 5.2 bn USD = 0.54 % of a
  quarter (ensemble 0.52 ± 0.14, range 0.31–0.76), peak 1.4 % of a week in mid-October, August wave 0.13 % (≈ EUR 1.2
  bn, inside IfW's ex-ante 1–2 bn), September wave 0.41 %; 2018 3.1 bn = 0.32 %, peak 1.25 % in the first week of
  December; no pooling 0.86 / 0.45 %. Levers: bulk fleet to 20 cm −95 %, fairway +20 cm −41 %, tank barges to 40 cm
  −39 %, stocks +7 days −39 %, package −100 % (targeted stocks pending a rerun). Band: tanker floor 40 / 60 cm 0.33 /
  0.75 %; stocks ×1 (raw materials only) 2.16 %. The September 2026 trough (Kaub 26 cm on 9 Sep) → forecast-based
  profile (BfG 6-week medians, 19 weeks to 26 Oct) and the rerun `2026_seed42_pool_fc0910` (10 Sep) as the
  2026 baseline run: DEU 8.57 bn = 0.90 % of a quarter (Q3 0.51 %, Q4 0.39 %), peak 1.38 % of a week in
  mid-October — the September trough's second wave exceeds the August one because stocks had two weeks to
  refill and the tank-barge closures run to mid-October (a paper point: sequence and spacing of troughs);
  refresh when observations replace the forecast weeks. Sensitivities
  for the cluster: tanker floor 40/50/60 cm, inventories ± 50 %, Lower Rhine factor, v12 vs v13 rates,
  seeds.
- Two modelling decisions to state up front, both forced by the scale of the scope: the
  criticality threshold (2 % cost-share proxy for the partially-binding Leontief; strict
  Leontief let a negligible cross-border service input cascade — KI-29) and the give-up rule on
  the delivered price rather than the freight bill.
- Outputs: Rhine tonnage by week vs physical fleet capacity (the ex post consistency check);
  modal substitution (rail/road tonnage gained vs DB Cargo's ~100-barge ceiling); price
  surcharges on Rhine-dependent links vs observed freight-rate multiples; firm production losses
  by sector and NUTS2 (Figure 5: map of production loss, week of 10 Aug); share of Rhine-corridor
  firms producing below equilibrium vs the DIHK survey (33 % restricting, 6 % stopped, 29 Jul–4 Aug);
  value-added loss for DE and the EU vs the ex ante macro range (−0.1 to −0.4 pp of quarterly GDP)
  and the ex post Destatis production indices when they land (Sep–Nov 2026).
- Propagation: where losses land beyond the corridor (Figure 6: first-, second-, third-tier
  losses by country); role of inventories (sensitivity on `inventory_duration_targets`).

## 5. Discussion
- Three kinds of production restriction in the evidence, one of which the model resolves:
  (i) physical stoppages where no alternative mode exists at volume (refineries, steel, power,
  agri-food fed by barge) — captured by the switching-cost mechanism, 5.7 % of corridor firms (pooled baseline; 3.8 % under v12 logistics) vs
  the survey's 33 % restricting / 6 % stopped; (ii) cost-driven cuts of marginal output at 3–7×
  freight rates (gravel, fertiliser, grain, low-value chemicals) — only through the give-up rule,
  which needs cargo- or margin-specific thresholds; (iii) precautionary throttling to stretch stocks
  under an uncertain closure length (BASF mid-Aug, thyssenkrupp force majeure 16 Jul, Kehl) — NOT
  modelled (firms run at full rate until an input runs out): state this as the reason why the
  model's corridor-firm share stays far below the survey's 33 % although its macro loss now sits at the
  top of the ex-ante range, and as the natural next mechanism (a stock-stretching rule).

- What the model adds to the ex post econometrics: spatial and sectoral incidence, the
  substitution margins and their limits, the price channel.
- Limits: winner-take-all routing, no capacity rationing on the substitutes (rail slots, trucks/
  drivers) except through costs, annual MRIO vintage (2022) for a 2026 event, plant process routes.
- Policy: fleet adaptation (low-water vessels), Abladeoptimierung Mittelrhein, inventories,
  the value of the second rail track on the Rhine valley.
