# Rhine 2026 low-water paper — whole-EU DisruptSC

Working plan (started 2026-09-02). Two parallel tracks: **(1)** calibrate DisruptSC
to the whole EU as a new scope `EU` (data in `disrupt-sc-data/EU/`, runbook
`onboarding/RUNBOOK.md`, manifest `disrupt-sc-data/EU/scope_manifest.yaml`);
**(2)** assemble the empirical evidence on the summer-2026 Rhine low-water event
(and its 2018/2022 precedents) that the model run will be validated against
(`evidence/`).

## 1. Track 1 — the EU scope (calibration)

### 1.1 Design proposal (checkpoints for the user, RUNBOOK rule 3)

**Q1 — MRIO.** Recommended: **OECD ICIO 2022**, internal regions = EU27 + CHE
(28 country regions × 50 native sectors), external partners as blocs (Q2).
Rationale: 2022 vintage (the case study is 2026), the whole Romania toolchain
(extractor with `SECTOR_RESOLVED_IMPORTS` + `ZERO_EXTERNAL_TO_EXTERNAL`,
`compute_usd_per_ton_baci.py`, `check_scope.py`, `validation_metrics.py`,
`eurostat_mode_targets.py`) runs unchanged; sub-national geography comes from
firm placement (§1.3), which is how DisruptSC has always resolved space.
Alternative: **FIGARO-REG 2013** (288 NUTS2 regions with data-based inter-regional
flows — the only inter-regional IO of the EU, but 13 years old and 15.8k
region-sectors; JRC estimated its regional trade with gravity models anyway).
Third option: **FIGARO national 2022/2023** (Eurostat's own 46 × 64 table, EUR):
needs a download (~0.5 GB) and a new extractor script (1 day).

**Q2 — external blocs and gateways.** Singletons: GBR, NOR, TUR, UKR, RUS, USA,
CHN. Directional blocs: MEA (Gulf + Levant + North Africa: SAU ARE ISR JOR EGY
MAR TUN), ASI (rest of Asia-Pacific), AME (rest of Americas), AFR (sub-Saharan),
ROW (ICIO ROW, which hides the Western Balkans + MDA + BLR + Central Asia).
Gateways: **maritime blocs attached at SEA nodes** (Atlantic edge of the maritime
layer at 32°W for AME/USA/AFR-Atlantic, the Suez approach at 32.3°E/29.6°N for
ASI/CHN/MEA-east, Gibraltar strait for AFR-west/MAR) so that the *port of entry
is chosen by routing per OD pair* — Rotterdam/Antwerp for the Rhine basin, Hamburg
for the north, Genoa/Trieste for the Po, Piraeus for Greece. This needs a small
model change: `init_pipeline/agents.py` snaps countries to **road** nodes only;
add a config switch (`country_attachment: roads | any`) so a Point at sea snaps
to the nearest maritime node. Land partners at their real crossings: GBR at the
Channel (sea node off Dover, or the Calais road node if the switch is refused),
NOR at Svinesund, RUS at the Baltic sea node (Primorsk/Ust-Luga lane) — 2022
trade was fuels by sea/pipeline, UKR at Medyka/Dorohusk (PL border), TUR at
Kapitan Andreevo (BG border; TR roads are absent from TEN-T).

**Q3 — sectors.** Keep the 50 native ICIO codes (no aggregation; services do
not use the transport network anyway), retype `C19` as `oil_and_gas` so refined
petroleum moves as liquid bulk (Romania lesson), `usd_per_ton` from BACI 2023
EU-wide trade mix.

**Q4 — spatial resolution.** Households at **NUTS2** (301 EU/EFTA regions with
2023 population; region = ISO3, `subregion_nuts2` = code). Firms via the
firm-extractor: plant-level for the Rhine-critical concentrated sectors (C19
refineries and C20 chemicals from Climate TRACE + GEM chemicals inventory, C24A
steel from GIST, C23 cement from GCCT, D power from the 8 GEM trackers, B05/B07
mines), **NUTS3 employment** (`nama_10r_3empers`, 2022) for dispersed
manufacturing and services, population fallback. Expected size ≈ 28 regions ×
50 sectors × (NUTS2/3 points) ≈ 10–15 k firms, ~200 k links — 5–7× Romania
(Romania: build 2 min, one weekly step ≈ 15 s → EU ≈ 15–30 min build, a
26-week run ≈ 1–2 h). NUTS3 everywhere (≈ 50 k firms) is possible but not
needed for the paper.

**Q5 — downloads to approve.** GISCO NUTS 2021 polygons (`NUTS_RG_20M_2021_4326.geojson`,
~25 MB, public), BACI HS17 2023 if not on disk (~1 GB), Climate TRACE API pulls
(no download), GEM trackers already on disk.

### 1.2 Phase plan (runbook phases → EU specifics)

| Phase | EU specifics | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 3 trade geography | blocs of Q2; `countries.geojson` points at sea/border nodes | manifest `decisions` |
| 4 MRIO extraction | `extract_mrio_oecd.py`: `INTERNAL_REGIONS` = 28 codes, blocs as Q2, `SECTOR_RESOLVED_IMPORTS`, `ZERO_EXTERNAL_TO_EXTERNAL`; `init_sector_table_config.py` + `compute_usd_per_ton_baci.py --scope <28 ISO3>`; `check_scope.py EU --economic-only` | `EU/Economic/{mrio.csv,sector_table.csv}` |
| 5 transport | **done provisionally** (`tent_to_scope.py`); add per-edge waterway **capacities** (tons/day) for the Rhine chain from CCNR/Destatis tonnages (scenario needs them), rail corridor capacities from RFC data; every other edge unconstrained (no per-mode defaults since 21 Sep 2026) | `EU/Transport/*` + `transport_capacity_overrides` in the config |
| 6 spatial | NUTS2 households from GISCO + `population_nuts_2023.csv`; firm-extractor config `EU/firm_extractor_config.yaml` (28 countries) | `EU/Spatial/*` |
| 7 run | `config/user_defined_EU.local.yaml` (draft committed alongside this README, Romania-calibrated logistics as the prior); `initial_state` with `--seed 42` | run folder + sanity report |
| 8 validation | `validation_metrics.py EU`; modal split vs Eurostat `tran_hv_frmod` per country and per NST (DE, NL, BE, FR, AT, PL, IT…); port shares vs Eurostat `mar_go_aa`; Rhine tonnage vs CCNR/Destatis (Emmerich–Lobith cross-section ≈ 150 Mt/yr); trade by partner vs Comext | `EU/validation_report.md` |

### 1.2b Status 2026-09-03 and the calibration plan

Built and committed: ICIO 2022 extraction (28 × 50, 12 blocs), sector table with
EU-mix BACI 2023 unit values, 251 NUTS2 households, 12,874 firm-extractor firm points,
12 gateway points on sea/border nodes (`country_attachment: any`, disrupt-sc 1ab423d).
Two bugs found on the way and fixed in disrupt-sc: `sectors_to_exclude: None` excluded
sector N from every ICIO scope (KI-24, 0bf2124); the route cache deep-copied every
reversed route (92 of 130 build minutes on the EU scope, 7363ad4).

**Smoke run** (population-weighted firms, `output/EU/20260903_072310`): output 92 % of
MRIO, exports 98 %, imports 87 %, gateway shares = MRIO-implied. Flow assignment is
far off and is the calibration job (`studies/rhine2026/flow_checks.py`):

| Check | Model | Real | Lever |
|---|---|---|---|
| inland tkm split EU (road/rail/IWW) | 46.5 / 40.1 / 13.4 | 78.1 / 16.9 / 5.0 (Eurostat 2023) | mode costs, transfer costs, VOT (per cargo) |
| DE split | 41 / 30 / 29 | 73 / 21 / 7 | idem; IWW ×4 too high |
| Rhine at Kaub (`rhine_mainz_koblenz`) | 182 Mt/yr | ≈ 50 | waterway cost / transfers |
| Rhine at Emmerich | 203 Mt/yr | 118 | idem |
| Antwerp / Trieste / Venice port entries | 55 / 183 / 150 Mt | 242 / 51 / 25 | **port capacities** (binary constraint, `port_capacities.py`) |

Progress 3 Sep (details per version in `disrupt-sc-data/EU/calibration_log.md`): v2 cost
move (Kaub 132 → 106 Mt, containers on target); v3 inert → root cause found: agents were
snapped to rail/waterway nodes (`agent_attachment: roads`, disrupt-sc 9eb15df); v4 on road
nodes: rail collapses to 3 % (over-inflated rail/transfer costs from v2–v3), Rhine profile
near real (Kaub 68 Mt); v5 = sea-leg value of time (Trieste 50 Mt vs 51, Antwerp ×4);
v6–v12 = seven harness iterations of ~2 min each on rail cost/speed, terminal transfers and
the barge value of time for containers. **v12 adopted**: containers 66/28/7 (DE 68/28/5),
dry bulk 56/27/17 (53/27/20), Emmerich 127 Mt (118), Köln 94 (88), Kaub 68 (50); residuals:
liquid bulk rail-heavy (52 vs 42 %), no short-haul road by construction, one EU-wide rail
cost too strong for FR/IT/AT and too weak for DE, Upper Rhine under-served.

Plan: (1) firm-level baseline — done (`20260903_094137`, 42 min; economics 93.6 % / 98 % /
89 %; flow fit unchanged in structure: Kaub 132 Mt, Antwerp 53 Mt, rail 40 %); (2) v2 =
per-port throughput capacities (Eurostat 2023 × 1.3 peak) through
`transport_capacity_overrides` with `capacity_constraint: binary`, which blocks
over-capacity terminals without re-pricing every edge, plus a first cost move (waterways
0.0045 → 0.010, rail 0.040 → 0.044, roads 0.055 → 0.050 USD/tkm, river transfers 24 h/6 USD
with container 12 h/4 and liquid 16 h/4, rail transfers 8 h/5) — running; (3) refit per
cargo class against the DE/NL/EU NST targets (Romania procedure: scalars in range first,
then per-cargo transfer costs, always with `--seed 42`); (4) check the Rhine profile
against `scenarios/rhine_capacities.csv`. Every iteration is logged in
`disrupt-sc-data/EU/calibration_log.md`. Runtime was ≈ 42 min per full rebuild, 7 min per
weekly step (12.6 GB RAM); since 312de8d a cost iteration is
`onboarding/scripts/reroute_baseline.py EU` (minutes: re-route the cached supply chain with
the current costs, same flow columns as a full export) and a confirming full run keeps the
agent and supply-chain caches (scipy Dijkstra replaces the 7.7-min networkx pass).

Scenario side (independent of the calibration): `baseline_capacities.py` derives finite
capacities for every rail/road/waterway edge from the calibrated baseline (baseline load ×
headroom, rail 1.3 / road 1.5 as stated assumptions to sweep) and gives the Rhine edges
their normal-year cross-sections; `run_rhine.py` merges that CSV and the port capacities
into the scenario run's overrides, so rail can absorb only its headroom (DB Cargo's
≈ 100-barge ceiling) instead of the whole Rhine traffic.

### 1.3 Calibration targets specific to the Rhine study

- **Rhine cross-section tonnage** (Emmerich/Lobith ≈ 140–160 Mt/yr; Kaub ≈ 50–60
  Mt/yr; Basel ≈ 5–6 Mt/yr) — the model's edge flows on `rhine_*` must reproduce
  the profile down the river; commodity mix (ores/coal to Duisburg, oil products
  and chemicals to Ludwigshafen/Karlsruhe, containers Rotterdam–Basel).
- **Modal split of DE/NL** by NST cargo class (fetched targets): DE total
  62/28/9 road/rail/IWW, NL 57/6/38; dry bulk DE 53/27/20, liquid DE 28/42/30,
  NL liquid 8/2/90.
- **Port shares** of EU maritime imports (Rotterdam ≈ 440 Mt, Antwerp ≈ 270,
  Hamburg ≈ 110, Marseille, Algeciras, Valencia, Genoa, Piraeus…).

## 2. Track 2 — case-study evidence (validation)

Files in `evidence/` (web-collected 2026-09-02/03, every fact dated and sourced):
- `evidence_rhine2026_timeline.md` — what happened in summer 2026 (Kaub gauge
  trajectory day by day, freight, surcharges, industrial statements, macro estimates,
  policy, other rivers, meteorology, confounders; ~150 sources).
- `evidence_rhine_literature.md` — annotated bibliography of 2018/2022/2003 and
  the academic literature + a 73-row **validation-targets table** + 17 open gaps.
- `evidence_rhine_datasources.md` — machine-readable sources (PEGELONLINE,
  Destatis 46321, Eurostat iww_*, CCNR market observation, production indices,
  barge freight indices, Kleinwasserzuschlag tables) — partial (gauges complete).
- `update_20260903_supply_chain_damage.md` — 3 Sep sweep for supply-chain disruption and
  damage evaluations: the DIHK survey (n = 170, 29 Jul–4 Aug: 78 % higher costs, 72 %
  reorganised logistics, ≈ 33 % restricting production, 6 % stopped, 13 % site at risk),
  IHK Rheinhessen, the ex ante macro range (IfW −0.1/−0.2 pp Q3, Oxford Economics −0.2,
  Commerzbank −0.35, IW −0.4 pp p.a.; BVR nevertheless raised its 2026 forecast to 1.0 %),
  VCI's 3 Sep quarterly report, DB Cargo's substitution ceiling, the July truck-toll index,
  and the list of ex post anchors still to come (Destatis July IP ≈ 8 Sep, BASF Q3 27 Oct).
- `validation_targets_2026_surveys.md` — rows 74–83 of the validation-targets table
  (firm-level extensive margin, cost pass-through distribution, adaptation shares).

**The 2026 event in one paragraph.** After the least snowy Alpine winter since
1991 and a Rhine basin below normal precipitation every month from February, the
Kaub gauge (Rhine-km 546, the Middle Rhine bottleneck) fell below the reference
low-water level GlW (77 cm) around 8–12 July, was last above it on 20–22 July,
equalled the 2018 record (25 cm) on 31 July, set a new all-time low on 4 August
and reached **5 cm on 17 August** (series since 1880; Cologne 44 cm, Duisburg-
Ruhrort 126 cm, Emmerich −28 cm, Lobith 565 m³/s — all records). There was no
formal closure, but the river was "de facto divided" at Kaub from ~11 August:
standard vessels loaded 10–20 %, only nine purpose-built low-water tankers kept
moving 250–800 t parcels, KBN counted 90 kt/week past the bottleneck instead of
400 kt (−77 %), ARA→Karlsruhe tanker rates rose from EUR 45/t (June) to EUR
215/t (mid-August, ARA→Basel 275/t), container surcharges reached EUR 1,335/20'.
Rain from 18 August lifted Kaub to 77 cm on 29 August (never above GlW); on
2 September it was falling again (54 cm) with the BfG forecasting 37–40 cm by
6 September; it kept falling, to 26 cm on 9 September (2.2b). Named impacts: LyondellBasell (butadiene FM 16 Jul), Covestro
(polyether polyols FM 7 Aug), BASF (isolated bottlenecks, plasticiser FM,
"reduced capacity"), Evonik, Lanxess, thyssenkrupp (own push convoys stopped
14 Jul, furnace output "moderately" reduced, rail share doubled), MiRO Karlsruhe
(tankers at 1/3, 50 % of usual rail capacity because the right-bank Rhine railway
is closed until 12 Dec 2026), EnBW/Uniper. Macro: IfW −0.1/−0.2 pp Q3 GDP,
Commerzbank −0.35 pp, IW up to −0.4 pp p.a., Bundesbank "at best slight growth".
Confounders: Hormuz-driven oil prices, weak cracker demand (65–70 %), the rail
line closure, Dutch port strikes.

**Ten numbers the model must reproduce (2018 as the calibrated precedent):**

| # | Target | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | German IWW tonnage per Kaub day < 78 cm | −0.87 % (t), −0.41 % (t−1); 30 days ≈ −25 % | Ademmer et al. 2023 |
| 2 | German industrial production per low-water day | −0.034 % (t), −0.024 % (t−1); ≈ −1 % per 30 days; peak −1.5 % (Nov 2018) | Ademmer et al. 2023 |
| 3 | Elasticity of IP to IWW volume | 0.036 (+0.03 lagged): −10 % IWW → −0.4 % IP → −0.1 % GDP | Ademmer et al. 2023 |
| 4 | German IWW 2018 | 198.0 Mt (−11.1 %); Nov 2018 −34 % y/y; tkm −15.5 % | Destatis; BDB |
| 5 | Traditional Rhine 2018 / 2022 | 165 Mt (−11 %) / 155.5 Mt (−7.8 %) | CCNR |
| 6 | Freight rates 2018 | liquid spot ≈ 4.5× normal, dry ≈ 2.5× (Oct–Nov); Rotterdam→Basel distillate $5 → $35/bbl | CCNR; EIA |
| 7 | Load factors vs Kaub | 78 cm 25 %; 55 cm 16 %; 40 cm ≈ 20 % (WSV); 25 cm 15 %; 2018 Duisburg barges 2,000 → 700 t | Contargo; van Dorsser; Platts |
| 8 | Modal substitution | rail +0.07 % per low-water day (weak); 2026: DB Cargo 400–900 wagons ≈ 200 barges, Kombiverkehr +2,000 TEU | Ademmer; DB Cargo |
| 9 | Firm level 2018 | BASF EBIT −EUR 250 m; chem-pharma production Q4 2018 −10 % q/q | BASF; VCI |
| 10 | 2026 throughput at Kaub | 60+30 kt/week vs 300+100 normal (−77 %) at Kaub 10–17 cm; rates 45 → 215 EUR/t | KBN; Argus |
| 11 | Sailing floors by vessel class | minimum operational draught CEMT II/III 1.20 m, IV 1.30, V 1.40, VI 1.50, pusher barge 1.70; under-keel clearance 10–20 cm (dry bulk, containers), 20–30 cm (tankers, pushers); depth at Kaub = gauge + 1.12 m → Class V+ stop near 1.5 m depth (42 cm: 5 of 40 Contargo ships), only Class II/III at 25 cm; coal barges to Staudinger stop at Kaub < 40 cm (2022) | van Dorsser et al. 2020; Contargo; Reuters |

Scenario tables built from this evidence (in `scenarios/`): `2026.csv` (weekly
Kaub profile 22 Jun → 26 Oct: PEGELONLINE daily means to 10 Sep, then the BfG 6-week forecast and
assumptions, flagged), `2018.csv` (BfG DGJ daily means, 16 Jul → 10 Dec 2018; the
daily series `kaub_daily_2018.csv` / `kaub_daily_2026.csv` carry their source, and
`kaub_daily_crosscheck.csv` compares the yearbook with the raw 15-min data: MAE 0.3 cm),
`draught_table.csv` (Kaub cm → aggregate capacity factor past Kaub, with the
per-vessel GMS load factor and the anchoring source per row);
`rhine_capacities.csv` (normal-year Mt/yr and tons/day per named segment: CCNR
cross-sections at Emmerich 117.9 Mt and Iffezheim 16.0 Mt for 2023, Kaub ≈ 50 Mt and the
rest interpolated from port volumes, all interpolations marked ESTIMATE).
`python studies/rhine2026/run_rhine.py --profile 2026 --dry-run` prints the weekly
schedule: 15 disrupted weeks from 22 June, capacity −18 % (105 cm) to −91 % (11 cm, week
of 10 August), −77 % on the 17 August week, −50 % after the rain, 8 recovery weeks.

### 2.1 Observable ↔ model output mapping

| Empirical observable | Model quantity | Where in the output |
|---|---|---|
| Kaub gauge → max draught → load factor (weekly) | scenario input: `capacity_reduction` on `rhine_mainz_koblenz` (and `rhine_koblenz_bonn`…) per week | `disruptions:` list, one entry per week with `duration: 1` and the week's reduction, or a `Recovery` curve |
| Rhine tonnage at Kaub / Emmerich (Destatis monthly, CCNR) | edge tons on `rhine_*` per step | `transport_edges_with_flows_<t>.geojson`, logistics report |
| Modal shift to rail/road (DB Cargo, Destatis rail/road monthly) | tons on parallel rail (Rhine valley lines) and road edges | same |
| Barge spot rate × 5–10, Kleinwasserzuschlag | congestion multiplier on the constrained edge; share of links rerouted; delivered-price increase | `link.cost_per_ton` change, price indices in `firm_data.csv` |
| Industrial production dip (Destatis by WZ: C19, C20, C24; Kiel: −1 % IP per 30 days < 78 cm) | firm production loss by sector/region | `firm_data.csv`, household-loss headline |
| Named-firm impacts (BASF Ludwigshafen, ThyssenKrupp Duisburg, refineries) | production of the plant-level firms placed by firm-extractor | firm-level rows |
| Macro (GDP effect 2018 ≈ −0.3 %, Bundesbank) | total value-added loss, EU-wide and DE | aggregate loss series |

### 2.2a Mechanism (decided 2026-09-03, no capacity-constrained routing)

Capacity-constrained routing does not scale to this scope (197k OD groups; killed after
81 CPU-minutes), so low water is represented with two mechanisms the model handles cheaply:
- **cost shock** (`transport_cost_shock`, disrupt-sc c641fa5): the Kaub edge stays open but
  its cost is multiplied by 1/(capacity factor) — barges at 40 % load cost 2.5× per ton, the
  model's Kleinwasserzuschlag. A buyer whose route crosses it pays the surcharge (passed into
  the price via `transport_share`), reroutes when rail or road is cheaper (with the modal-switch
  penalty), or gives up beyond `price_increase_threshold`.
- **closure** for the weeks below the sailing floor (`--closure-threshold 0.75`: Kaub 24, 11
  and 27 cm, 3–23 Aug 2026): existing `transport_disruption` mechanics.
- **closure floors by cargo class — THE BASELINE RULE since 6 Sep (user decision 'adopt it')** (5 Sep,
  driver commit f726fa5): the fleet does
  not stop at one gauge. Large container vessels (CEMT V/VI, empty draught 1.4–1.5 m plus 20 cm
  under-keel clearance) stop at Kaub ≤ 40 cm (Contargo: "practically impossible" at 40 cm; 5 of
  40 ships still ran at 42 cm on 16 Oct 2018), tank barges (30 cm clearance) at ≤ 50 cm, the small
  dry-bulk units (CEMT II–IV) at ≤ 30 cm (only Class II/III sailed at the 25 cm record; van Dorsser
  et al. 2020, Table 1; depth at Kaub = gauge + 1.12 m). A week is a closure for the classes at or
  below their floor and a cost shock for the others: one `transport_cost_shock` per week with a
  per-cargo multiplier dict (closed classes × 10⁶ on the Kaub edge → bulk gives up through its
  switching costs, containers reroute at the usual penalty); a week where every class is closed
  stays a `transport_disruption`. `--closure-floors none` reproduces the single-floor runs.
  Schedule on the daily-data profiles (`--dry-run`, F4): 2026 — every class closed 27 Jul–23 Aug
  (4 weeks; the observed week of 27 Jul averages 29 cm), tank barges also in the 7 Sep assumption
  week; 2018 — tank barges 6 weeks (15–28 Oct, 5 Nov–2 Dec), containers 4 (15–28 Oct, 19 Nov–2
  Dec), dry bulk 1 (22 Oct). The Lower Rhine (Duisburg–Ruhrort, push convoys) is not shocked.
- **voyage-level surcharge (7 Sep, user decision):** the runs of 3–7 Sep priced the low-water surcharge on
  the 85 km Kaub edge only, a seventh of a Rotterdam–Mannheim voyage, so delivered prices never rose
  more than 6 % and the give-up thresholds could not bind (grid runs 7–8 identical to the baselines). A
  vessel is loaded to the Kaub draught for its whole voyage and the Kleinwasserzuschlag is charged per
  ton on the whole trip, so the driver now applies the week's multiplier to every Rhine edge from
  Koblenz upstream (10 edges, Basel … Mainz–Koblenz, the order of `scenarios/rhine_capacities.csv`) and
  1 + (m − 1)/3 to the 20 Lower Rhine edges (Koblenz … Rotterdam; their own gauges: Duisburg-Ruhrort
  loads ≈ 25 % vs ≈ 10 % at Kaub in Aug 2026, ≈ 50 % vs 22 % in Oct 2018 — an assumption to refine with
  a Lower Rhine draught table). Closures and class floors stay on the Kaub edge. `--surcharge-scope
  kaub` reproduces the edge-local runs. Compromise to state: a Rotterdam–Mannheim voyage pays the full
  factor on its upstream half and the Lower Rhine factor on the other, a Rotterdam–Duisburg voyage only
  the Lower Rhine factor.
- **input pooling across regions (9 Sep, user decision; `evidence/input_substitution_literature.md`):**
  every firm-level model with re-sourcing pools the same product across the buyer's existing
  suppliers, instantly, limited by their spare capacity; short-run elasticities are bimodal (≈ 0.2
  across sources of differentiated inputs, commodities substitutable subject to logistics). The
  poolable products (`additional_data/product_substitutability.csv`, 18 of 50 sectors) form one input
  per product across regions: stocks and coefficients summed in the partially-binding Leontief
  constraint, consumption drawn from the region that has stock, the pool's order split across all its
  suppliers by baseline share × fill-rate signal so an under-delivering region loses orders up to the
  others' headroom. Differentiated products, services and import bundles stay region-keyed. Before
  this, 24 of the 29 firms at zero in the 2018 v13 second wave held the missing product from another
  region. The 2 % materiality floor now applies to the pooled share, which is why the first closed
  weeks cost more than under v13 (see the run table). Loss accounting: gross, net (backlog left for
  goods and construction + gross for perishable sectors) and the carrying cost of the backlog.
`run_rhine.py --profile 2026 --dry-run` prints the schedule (×1.2 in late June, ×3 mid-July,
×3.8 the week of 27 July, closed 3–23 August, ×2–3 through September).
Verified end to end on the bundled Testkistan scope (3 Sep): a ×1.5 shock on the main road for
2 steps surcharges 21 of 31 links (+10 % price = transport share × 50 %), loses no delivery,
propagates into downstream prices the next step (+14 %) and decays after the shock; a ×3 shock
drops the affected deliveries as too expensive because that demo network has no alternative.
This matches what the evidence says happened: the market cleared by price first (rates ×2–5),
then by rationing and production cuts, with rail absorbing only a tenth of the tonnage. The
ex post check is physical: modelled weekly Rhine tonnage must not exceed the fleet's capacity
at that week's gauge, otherwise the multiplier is too low for that week.
- **substitution ceiling** (`substitution_share`, disrupt-sc 12e085b): run 2 showed that with
  unlimited road and rail a closure costs nothing but the detour price (fill rate 100 % through
  the first closure week). With the ceiling, a link hit by a shock delivers
  `capacity_factor + substitution_share × (1 − capacity_factor)` of its plan (closure:
  `substitution_share`), barges carry their part at the surcharged cost, the alternative route
  the rest, and the shortfall is lost. 0.30 for the main run (DB Cargo ≈ 100 of ≈ 1,000 barges
  by rail; road bound by drivers and tank equipment), 0.15 and 0.50 as sensitivities. The Rhine
  tonnage then equals the fleet's capacity by construction. The give-up rule
(`price_increase_threshold` 2 on the freight bill) should be relaxed for the scenario runs
(`--price-threshold`), since shippers paid ×5 freight on goods worth 20–50× the freight.

Port choice is calibrated by cost as well: a per-mode value of time (`cost_of_time:
{container: {default: 1.6, maritime: 0.15}}`, same commit) stops the inland service-quality
VOT from pricing the sea leg, which had sent Asian imports into the nearest Adriatic port
(Suez→Munich via Trieste 217 vs via Rotterdam 402 USD/t, of which sea time 130 vs 288).

### 2.2b Runs (3 Sep, after the v12 baseline)

**Final baseline (adopted 06 Sep 2026; voyage-level surcharge added 07 Sep, cargo-specific rates 08 Sep, input pooling 09 Sep):** `run_rhine.py --profile 2026
--no-open --seed 42` and `--profile 2018` with the tracked config (survey criticality, import bundles by MRIO
composition, buyer-industry inventories with grid/pipeline inputs at the coping duration, cargo-specific
switching costs, delivered-price threshold 5 — now the config value —, no quantity cap) and the driver
logistics v13 (8 Sep: waterway rates by vessel type — tank barges 0.038, container vessels 0.022, convoy
bulk 0.010 USD/tkm; tank-car rail 0.085 and road tankers 0.130 for liquids; container river VOT 0.35;
liquid split 28/41/31, Kaub 62 Mt) and the driver defaults (closure floors container ≤ 40 cm, tank
barges ≤ 50 cm, dry bulk ≤ 30 cm; voyage-level surcharge:
the week's multiplier on the ten Rhine edges from Koblenz upstream and a third of the excess on the twenty
Lower Rhine edges; daily-data profiles `scenarios/2026.csv`, `scenarios/2018.csv`) and, since 9 Sep, input
pooling of the 18 commodity-like products across regions (`input_pooling.enabled`,
`additional_data/product_substitutability.csv`, `adaptive_supplier_weight`). Runs
`C:\dsc_runs\rhine2026\2026_seed42_pool` and `2018_seed42_pool` (20 recovery weeks, light exports) — the
final baseline (confirmed by the user 10 Sep; the 2026 run is superseded by the forecast-based rerun below); their
`--no-pooling` twins are `2026_seed42_rates` /
`2018_seed42_rates` (full exports: the price section comes from those), and the v12-logistics runs `…_voyage` /
`…_floors` remain as the conservative rung of the ladder (the figures F4–F6 in `figures/` still come from the
floors runs; regenerate from the pooled runs at paper time). Results (14 Sep, reproducible seed-42 draw, cluster runs `2026_fc0910_base` / `2018_baseline`): 2026 on the
forecast-based 19-week profile DEU 26.2 bn USD (2.74 % of a quarter, peak 5.3 % of a week after the last tank-barge
closure in mid-October; ensemble of eleven draws 2.29 ± 0.47 %), 2018 16.5 bn (1.73 %, peak 3.6 % of a week in the
second week of December). The laptop runs of 5–10 Sep (0.90 % / 0.58 %) were one unreproducible draw (KI-34); delivered prices up to +13 % in surcharge weeks and +29 % in a closure week (v13
runs); see the table below for the ladder that led there.

**September 2026 trough (found 9 Sep 23:30):** after the profile's observed window (to 4 Sep) the gauge kept
falling — PEGELONLINE daily means 38.1 cm on 5 Sep, 32.6 on 6 Sep, 28.9 on 8 Sep, 25.9 on 9 Sep — so the week
of 7 Sep (time step 12) is a full closure under the floors, not the 45 cm tank-only assumption, and the week of
14 Sep probably too. Every 2026 run above is out of date from step 12 on. The user chose (10 Sep) a
forecast-based rerun now: `fetch_kaub.py` (PEGELONLINE REST API, daily means in legal time, weekly rows, BfG
6-week medians, extension) rebuilt `scenarios/2026.csv` as 19 weeks — observations to 10 Sep, ENS medians to
18 Oct, 85/105 cm assumptions for 19/26 Oct; the 15-week version is in git history — and queue v16 runs it as
`2026_seed42_pool_fc0910` (refresh again when observations replace the forecast weeks);
`evidence/kaub_september_2026_outlook.md` collects the BfG/ELWIS forecasts and the September reporting.

**Adaptation counterfactuals and the cluster batch (10 Sep, user decisions: Nature Communications, cluster,
12 recovery weeks):** plan in `adaptation_counterfactuals.md`; driver switches `--gauge-offset` (fairway
deepening), `--closure-floors` + `scenarios/draught_table_lowwater.csv` (low-water fleet), `--inventory-add-days`
(stocks, global or targeted), `--rail-relief` (tank-car rail at the bulk rate in shock weeks — the cost version,
decided over a capacity cap), `--inventory-scale` and `--cache-isolation` for the grid; batch definition
`cluster/jobs_20260910.txt` (base + 7 counterfactuals + 10 sensitivity runs on the forecast-based profile),
launcher `cluster/launch_rhine_batch.sh` (Slurm `--wrap` jobs in the Ecuador convention, base first, postprocess
and compare jobs chained), `cluster/sync_to_cluster.sh` (EU data + caches), `cluster/collect_from_cluster.sh`.
Outlook (10 Sep): the BfG 6-week forecast of 7 Sep gives weekly medians (5–95 %) of 16 (10–23) cm for 7–13 Sep,
12 (−3–30) for 14–20 Sep, 22 (−15–77) for 21–27 Sep, 42 for 28 Sep–4 Oct, 49 for 5–11 Oct and 68 for 12–18 Oct
(`scenarios/bfg_6week_kaub_20260907.csv`); the 14-day forecast of 9 Sep keeps Kaub below GlW with 100 %
probability through 22 Sep and the 4-day forecast of 10 Sep stays at 22–28 cm to 14 Sep. Under the floors the
median path closes every class through 27 Sep and tank barges into October, so the 2026 profile has to be
extended to mid-October and the event end is unlikely before late October.

With unlimited road/rail substitutes the closure costs only the detour price: the delivered-price surcharge on the most exposed link peaks at 9 % in the closure weeks (3–6 % in the ×1.2–1.6 weeks), no link above 10 %, fill rate 100 % every week — every real-economy effect must come from the substitution ceiling; through the first closure week: fill 100 %, output loss < 0.001 %, max delivered-price rise 9 % — with unlimited road/rail every displaced ton moves at once (see §2.2a, substitution ceiling) |

Fill rate of routed links 78 % at the trough; delivered-price surcharge never above 10 %. Diagnosis: the Kaub edge carries 2.7 bn USD/week of link value (0.3 % of EU output); the ceiling withholds up to 70 % of it and the partially-binding Leontief with the 2 % cost-share proxy propagates every shortfall downstream nearly one-for-one (peak consumption loss = 25 × the whole Kaub throughput). `analysis.txt` in the run folder. |

The week-0 economies are identical to the dollar (production, profit, stocks, routed value per cargo class within 0.3 %), parameters and disruption lists are identical; the difference is in the transport response: liquid bulk is blocked 4–10 % of its value in closure weeks on the cluster against 3.5–4 % here, dry bulk and containers behave alike, and the cluster's losses escalate within a closure block (655 / 955 / 1,734 / 2,059 vs 614 / 729 / 627 / 592).

### 2.2c Memory and run-time on the EU scope (3 Sep, evening)

Run 2's weekly steps slowed from 7–9 min to 15–18 min with one 78-min spike, and the relaunched
main run stalled at step 0 with 23 GB private memory on a 31 GB machine (page-file thrashing, CPU
time frozen). A stage-by-stage profile of the initialisation (`--cache auto`, all four caches
current) explains it: the supply-chain pickle alone expands to **6 GB** in memory (786k
`CommercialLink` objects plus the networkx graph), the routes pickle carries a *second* copy of it
plus the `Route` objects, and `run.py` loaded both — the interpreter never returns the peak. Fixes
and consequences:

- disrupt-sc 5e09946: when the routes cache is current, the supply-chain stage and the
  pre-routing `set_initial_conditions` (≈ 10 min on the EU scope) are skipped — the routes
  pickle carries them, and every simulation entry point resets the initial conditions itself.
- Scenario outputs live outside the OneDrive-synced repo (`C:\dsc_runs
hine2026`), because the
  per-step link export grows a multi-GB CSV that the sync client re-hashes.
- disrupt-sc 369a8aa: `Route` objects were ~7 kB each (three copies of their tuples plus a
  dict) and route assignment built one per link — 786k objects for 143k distinct routes. Now
  slots + one copy of the tuples, and `intern_routes()` shares one Route per node sequence
  across links, route plans and the library (older caches are interned on load and re-saved).
- Verified on the relaunched main run (22:30): 9.75 GB private after the routes load, flat at
  9.5–10.1 GB through week 7, ~10 min per week, no paging (`EU/runs/mem_watch.csv`).
- Diagnosis of run 2's slowdown: its private memory exceeded the RAM, the OS trimmed the
  working set to ~10 GB and every step paged the routes back in. Per-step growth during the
  closure weeks (alternative routes, chunked shipments) remains to be measured.

### 2.2 Scenario construction

1. Weekly Kaub levels (`scenarios/2026.csv`: PEGELONLINE daily means 22 Jun – 4 Sep 2026
   from the gauge's long-term raw download, `kaub_daily_2026.csv`; the BfG forecast for
   6 Sep — superseded 10 Sep by the forecast-based profile: observations to 10 Sep, BfG 6-week ENS
   medians to 18 Oct, assumptions to 26 Oct (19 weeks, `fetch_kaub.py`); the press-based first version is kept as
   `2026_press.csv`. `scenarios/2018.csv`: weekly means of the verified BfG yearbook (DGJ)
   daily means, `kaub_daily_2018.csv`, 16 Jul – 10 Dec 2018; the reconstructed series is
   kept as `2018_reconstructed.csv`) →
   `scenarios/draught_table.csv` (aggregate capacity factor past Kaub: 0.60 at GlW,
   0.30 at 40 cm, 0.22 at 25 cm, 0.05 at 5 cm) → weekly `capacity_reduction` on
   `rhine_mainz_koblenz` via `run_rhine.py`; since 5 Sep the weekly gauge is also compared
   with the sailing floor of each cargo class (`--closure-floors`, §2.2a).
2. Waterway capacities in tons/day for the Rhine chain (`scenarios/rhine_capacities.csv`,
   CCNR cross-sections Emmerich 117.9 Mt and Iffezheim 16.0 Mt in 2023, Kaub ≈ 50 Mt
   estimated) so that a 70 % capacity loss actually binds. **Open design point**: the
   gradual congestion multiplier is 0.5 at zero load and 1.0 only at 80 % utilisation,
   so switching `capacity_constraint` on re-prices every edge relative to the
   calibrated (unconstrained) baseline. Candidate fix for the scenario runs: derive
   per-edge capacities from the baseline flows (capacity = 1.25 × baseline load,
   floored) for all modes so that the baseline sits at u ≈ 0.8 (multiplier ≈ 1)
   everywhere, and only the Rhine edges get the real (lower, low-water) capacities.
   (Moot since 21 Sep 2026: the capacity gate is on-off and re-prices nothing;
   only the named edges have capacities, `docs/architecture/transport-capacity.md`.)
3. Rail alternative capacity (Rhine valley lines, DB Cargo statements) bounds the
   modal shift — corridor capacities via `transport_capacity_overrides` on the
   named rail edges (the only capacity channel).
4. Runs: baseline; 2026 observed profile; counterfactuals (2018 profile,
   full closure 8 weeks, "Abladeoptimierung" +20 cm); sensitivities (rail
   capacity, inventories, `price_increase_threshold`).

## 3. Open decisions / questions for the user
