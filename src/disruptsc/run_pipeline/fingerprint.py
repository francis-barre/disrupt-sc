"""State-fingerprinting for resumable runs (criticality, Monte-Carlo).

A *fingerprint* captures everything that, if changed between two runs,
would invalidate already-computed results: code version, RNG seed, the
subset of config keys that drives agent / SC / route construction, and
the **filepaths** of the input data. We deliberately do not hash file
contents — it's the user's responsibility to bump the filename when the
data changes (e.g. ``mrio_oecd_2022.csv`` → ``mrio_oecd_2022_v2.csv``).
That keeps resume checks O(microseconds) rather than O(seconds).

Typical usage::

    payload = build_fingerprint(config, criticality_duration=duration)
    digest = fingerprint_hash(payload)
    save_fingerprint(payload, sidecar_path)

    prev = load_fingerprint(sidecar_path)
    if prev and prev["hash"] != digest:
        raise RuntimeError(diff_fingerprints(prev, payload))
