# Migrating from DisruptSC v1 to v2

v2.0.0 is a major release with breaking changes in the CLI, module layout, configuration schema, and data layout. This page lists what changed and how to adapt.

If you prefer not to migrate, the v1 line is preserved unchanged at:

- Branch: [`legacy/v1`](https://github.com/ccolon/disrupt-sc/tree/legacy/v1)
- Tag: [`v1-last-submodule`](https://github.com/ccolon/disrupt-sc/releases/tag/v1-last-submodule)

## CLI entry points

The console scripts keep the same names but now point to new modules.

| Script            | v1 target                                | v2 target                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `disruptsc`       | `disruptsc.main:main`                    | `disruptsc.run:main`                |
| `validate-inputs` | `disruptsc.model.input_validation:main`  | `disruptsc.validate_inputs:main`    |

**Impact:** If you installed v1 in editable mode and upgrade in place, reinstall with `pip install -e .` so entry points pick up the new targets.

CLI flags are largely the same (`--cache`, `--simulation_type`, `--duration`, `--cache_isolation`, `--version`). New in v2: `--flow_coverage`, `--seed`, `--log_level`, `--verbose`, `--open`. v1's `--io_cutoff` is replaced by `--flow_coverage`, which strictly takes a coverage fraction in (0, 1].

## Python API / module layout

v1's `Model`/`Parameters` orchestration is gone. v2 is pipeline-style: explicit stages for data loading, agent building, network building, routing, caching, and simulation.

| v1 import                                           | v2 equivalent                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from disruptsc.model.model import Model`           | removed; compose the pipeline directly via `disruptsc.run` or the `init_pipeline` / `run_pipeline` modules |
| `from disruptsc.parameters import Parameters`       | `from disruptsc.config import load_config, build_params` returning flat config dict + `TransportParams`/`SimParams`/`AgentParams`/`LogisticsParams` dataclasses from `disruptsc.params` |
| `disruptsc.model.agent_builders.{firm,household,country}` | `disruptsc.init_pipeline.agents` (consolidated)       |
| `disruptsc.model.network_builders.transport`        | `disruptsc.init_pipeline.transport`                        |
| `disruptsc.model.network_builders.supply_chain`     | `disruptsc.init_pipeline.supply_chain`                     |
| `disruptsc.model.utils.caching`                     | `disruptsc.run_pipeline.cache`                             |
| `disruptsc.model.validation.inputs`                 | `disruptsc.validate_inputs`                                |
| `disruptsc.simulation.factory.ExecutorFactory`      | functions in `disruptsc.run_pipeline.simulate` (`run_initial_state`, `run_disruption`, `run_criticality`) |
| `disruptsc.agents.transport_mixin`                  | `disruptsc.agents.transport_utils`                         |

The `Model` class is not replaced with a new class. If you were embedding DisruptSC as a library, the canonical entry point is now `disruptsc.run.main()` (read it top-to-bottom to see the pipeline stages) or call `disruptsc.run_pipeline.*` functions directly.

## Configuration changes

### Transport file paths

v1 had one GeoJSON per transport mode under `filepaths`. v2 consolidates them into two GeoPackage layers.

**v1:**
```yaml
filepaths:
  transport_modes: "Transport/transport_modes.csv"
  roads_edges:      "Transport/roads_edges.geojson"
  multimodal_edges: "Transport/multimodal_edges.geojson"
  maritime_edges:   "Transport/maritime_edges.geojson"
  airways_edges:    "Transport/airways_edges.geojson"
  railways_edges:   "Transport/railways_edges.geojson"
  waterways_edges:  "Transport/waterways_edges.geojson"
  pipelines_edges:  "Transport/pipelines_edges.geojson"
```

**v2:**
```yaml
filepaths:
  transport:  "Transport/transport.gpkg"
  multimodal: "Transport/multimodal.gpkg"
```

The GeoPackages carry per-mode layers internally. v1 per-mode GeoJSONs are no longer read.

### Logistics

- `shipment_methods_to_transport_modes` and `sector_types_to_shipment_method` are replaced by a single `logistics.sector_to_cargo_type` mapping with cargo types `dry_bulk`, `liquid_bulk`, `container`.
- New `logistics.dwell_times` and `logistics.loading_fees` are supported per multimodal transition.

### New top-level keys

- `capacity_routing_max_iterations` — number of capacity-aware routing iterations
- `default_transport_capacity` — fallback capacity per mode
- `enable_household_inventories` — households can now hold inventories
- `firm_transport_share`, `country_transport_share` — uniform transport-share defaults

### Renamed and changed: `io_cutoff` → `flow_coverage`

v1's `io_cutoff` was an absolute tech-coefficient threshold (e.g. 0.01 = keep inputs with coef > 1%). v2 reframes it as a **cumulative flow-coverage fraction**, applied **symmetrically**: for each buyer column *and* each supplier row, MRIO cells are sorted by absolute value (descending) and kept until their cumulative share reaches the value; the union of the two kept sets defines the modeled agents and links, so every kept agent retains at least this fraction of both its in-flows and out-flows. Default: **0.95**.

The legacy threshold mode is gone. If you had `io_cutoff: 0.01` (v1 behavior), the closest v2 equivalent is `flow_coverage: 0.99` or higher; otherwise just use the default 0.95. (`input_coverage` was a transitional name and is still accepted with a deprecation warning.)

The same rule now also drives internal-flow detection (which region-sectors get duplicated to allow self-supply), replacing v1's hidden 0.02 diagonal threshold.

### Deprecations

- `events` is still read but deprecated in favor of `disruptions`. v2 logs a warning and maps `events` → `disruptions`.

### Parameter folder flattened

Parameter files moved up one level: `config/parameters/*.yaml` → `config/*.yaml`.

### Scope parameter files no longer shipped (except Testkistan)

v1 shipped `user_defined_<scope>.yaml` for ECA, Ecuador, Gulf, Cambodia, Armenia, Italia, Global2, GulfTest. v2 ships only `config/user_defined_Testkistan.yaml` (for the bundled demo). Recreate your scope file locally as `config/user_defined_<scope>.local.yaml` (gitignored) — the loader reads `.local.yaml` on its own, no shared file required.

### Local overrides

v2 reads both `config/user_defined_<scope>.yaml` (committed) and `config/user_defined_<scope>.local.yaml` (gitignored). Either or both may be present; `.local.yaml` is layered on top. Use `.local.yaml` for personal tweaks (short `t_final`, local `DISRUPT_SC_DATA_PATH`, scenario parameters) without modifying shared config.

---

## Data layout

- The `data/` git submodule is removed. Bundled demo data for `Testkistan` is committed under `examples/data/Testkistan/`.
- For full regional scopes, clone the data repo alongside this repo (`../disrupt-sc-data`) or set `DISRUPT_SC_DATA_PATH`.
- Resolution order: `DISRUPT_SC_DATA_PATH` → sibling `../disrupt-sc-data` → bundled `examples/data/`.

If you had local edits inside the old `data/` submodule, move them into a cloned `disrupt-sc-data` or into the bundled example folder, and remove any `.gitmodules`/`data` submodule references from your working copy.

---

## Monte Carlo and simulation types

No breaking changes to `mc_repetitions` or `simulation_type` (`initial_state`, `disruption`, `criticality`). The v1 disruption **factory pattern is gone**: disruption parsing is a plain dispatch in `run_pipeline/disruption.py` (types: `transport_disruption`, `transport_disruption_probability`, `capital_destruction`, `productivity_shock`); the simulation loop lives in `run_pipeline/simulate.py`. With `seed` set, Monte-Carlo repetition *i* is seeded `seed + i`, so any repetition is reproducible on its own.

---

## Upgrade checklist

1. `git fetch && git checkout main` (v2 is now on `main`).
2. Reinstall: `pip install -e .` (picks up new console script targets).
3. Remove any `data/` submodule entry from your clone; either point `DISRUPT_SC_DATA_PATH` at your existing data folder or clone the data repo as `../disrupt-sc-data`.
4. Rewrite your scope's `filepaths` block to use `transport.gpkg` + `multimodal.gpkg` (or re-run against a freshly prepared data folder).
5. Update any direct Python imports per the table above.
6. Scan your scope YAML: rename `io_cutoff` → `flow_coverage` (and re-tune if you were using a legacy small-threshold value); rename `events` → `disruptions`; drop `shipment_methods_to_transport_modes` keys.
7. Move your scope file from `config/parameters/` to `config/`. Put the science parameters in a committed `user_defined_<scope>.yaml` and machine-specific paths in a gitignored `user_defined_<scope>.local.yaml` overlay.
8. `validate-inputs <scope>` to confirm the config is still readable.

If you hit something not covered here, open an issue; cite the v1 commit or behavior you're comparing against.
